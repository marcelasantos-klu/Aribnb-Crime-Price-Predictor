Objective (Final Version):
To analyze and model fashion retail product data in order to understand the key drivers of product performance (e.g., sales, customer interest, or profitability) and to develop predictive models that can help a fashion retailer optimize inventory, pricing, and product assortment decisions.

Using your fashion boutique dataset, the project will follow the data science lifecycle:
understanding the retail business domain,
preparing and enriching the data,
experimenting with multiple modeling techniques,
evaluating results with appropriate metrics,
and documenting insights, limitations, and future opportunities.
